# Second-hand-car-prices
You will find a project realized during my last year of Master in Quantitative Economics. The aim of this project is to predict the best second-hand car prices by taking in account their characteristics. To reach this goal, i used different supervised algorithm of classification. Data came from french website "ParuVendu" and i used Python.
